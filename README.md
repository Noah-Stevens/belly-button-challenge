Module 12 Interactive Visualizations Challenge

All of work is in the starter code folder.

The assignment contains four important parts:

Read in the samples.json file using the D3 Library
Creating a Bar Chart
Creating a Bubble Chart
Creating a Functioning Dashboard

This showcases the ability to create plots using .js and then visualize said plots via a .html page.

I did a little extra on the visual aspect and theming. For some reason, I could not get the style.css to work, but since it is just one page, I inserted the style into the header.

Thank you for reading! :))
